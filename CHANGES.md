## [Unreleased](https://github.com/sharpjs/Subatomix.Build.Packaging.PowerShellModule/compare/release/1.1.1..HEAD)
- Updated Psd1 generation to be more extensible and accept more MSBuild Properties. Properties need to be added as item Psd1ReplacementProperty.
- Added Auto-generation of Item lists for all different PowerShell file types.

  Items added:
  `PowerShellScript`, `PowerShellScriptModule`, `PowerShellModuleManifest`, `PowerShellFormat`, `PowerShellType`, `PowerShellSession`, `PowerShellRole`, `PowerShellCIMCmdlet`, `PowerShellHelp`, `PowerShell`

  The final `PowerShell` item includes all PowerShell file types in the current project. This allows for the following inclusion type in the project file:

  ```xml
  <ItemGroup>
    <Content Include="$(PowerShell)"/>
  </ItemGroup>
  ```
- Added Example in the Example Project of using `{PowerShellFormatFiles}` to automatically fill in two example format files.

- Added pre-defined properties of PowerShell{FileType} which generate quoted, comma-separated lists of the files of that type.
  
  Property Names: 
    `PowerShellScriptFiles`, `PowerShellScriptModuleFiles`, `PowerShellModuleManifestFiles`, `PowerShellFormatFiles`, `PowerShellTypeFiles`, `PowerShellSessionFiles`, `PowerShellRoleFiles`, `PowerShellCIMCmdletFiles`, `PowerShellHelpFiles`, `PowerShellFiles`

- Proper cleanup of generated psd1 files.

## [1.1.1](https://github.com/sharpjs/Subatomix.Build.Packaging.PowerShellModule/compare/release/1.1.0..release/1.1.1)
- Fix build error when using pre-release .NET SDK versions.

## [1.1.0](https://github.com/sharpjs/Subatomix.Build.Packaging.PowerShellModule/compare/release/1.0.0..release/1.1.0)
- Change: PowerShell files are now Content items instead of None items.
  Included file extensions:
  `.ps1`, `.psm1`, `.psd1`, `.ps1xml`, `.pssc`, `.psrc`, `.cdxml`.

  Additionally, the following fragment is now required in project files:

  ```xml
  <ItemGroup>
    <Content Include="$(PowerShellItemIncludes)"
             Exclude="$(DefaultItemExcludes);$(DefaultExcludesInProjectFolder)" />
  </ItemGroup>
  ```

- Change: Content items are now copied to the output and publish directories
  by default.

- Fix: Visual Studio now knows to rebuild the project when a `.psd1.t` file changes.

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/sharpjs/Subatomix.Build.Packaging.PowerShellModule/tree/release/1.0.0)
Initial release.
